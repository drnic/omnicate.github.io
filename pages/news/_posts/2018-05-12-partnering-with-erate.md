eRate and Working Group Two signed an agreement today where Working Group Two will be eRate’s partner for a mobile core network delivered as a service. The agreement allows eRate to expand its offer from billing and customer handling systems to include a customizable and programmable mobile core network.

The co-operation will also open a platform for third parties to build products and services for customers of eRate and Working Group Two. This attempt to create a product and eco-system across operators, borders and networks is new to the industry, and both parties are excited about the prospects of together providing a market place for developers. 

“eRate serves both IoT, m2m, consumer and business markets. With a strong set of partners and brands, we look forward to turbo-charging innovation in this market and competitiveness for eRate and eRates customers through the Working Group Two platform.
