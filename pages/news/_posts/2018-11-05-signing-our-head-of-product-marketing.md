We are proud and happy to announce that [Magnus Åkerblom-Wiker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mawiker/) has decided to join Working Group Two to take on the role as Head of Product Marketing.

Most recently Magnus worked at Prisjakt as their Chief Content Officer. Before that he worked at Google for 10 years, building sales and partner engineering teams in Europe and Asia/Pacific. His resume also includes working as a sales engineer at household names like IBM and as a developer.

Magnus has a strong technical background, as well as solid experience in working with product development and deployment together with partners. We believe his background with deep technical insight and a partner centric outlook, fits Working Group Two well.

At Working Group Two Magnus will be responsible for developing our product roadmap together with operator partners and developers, as well as handling sales dialogues with new and existing partners.
