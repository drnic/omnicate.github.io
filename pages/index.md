# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This fantastic reach has had a price. Standardization and local implementations have effectively stifled product innovation, leaving new products to come from internet players.

We are about combining the reach of mobile operators with the innovation capacity of an internet player. 

We do this in three steps: 
1. We have rebuilt the mobile core network the "internet way"
2. We make our software work consistently across radio networks enabling a "build once for everyone" functionality
3. We are opening up the core network functionality for developers to build products not previously possible

Our success is measured by users that find their mobile subscription that much more useful.
