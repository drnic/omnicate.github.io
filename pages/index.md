# What are we about?

We are bridging the mobile telecom and Internet worlds. We are giving mobile operators the innovation capacity of an Internet player. We do this by making the mobile core network accessible and programmable. 

We get there by 
1. Rebuilding mobile telco the "Internet way" 
2. Making our core network function across radio networks
3. Opening up previously unexposed network capabilities
4. Building the foundation for a product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work across operators.

We measure our success by end-users finding their mobile subscription much more useful.
