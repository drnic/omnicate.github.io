# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This reach has a price. Standardization and local implementations have effectively stifled product innovation, leaving new products to come from internet players.

We are about combining the reach of mobile operators with the innovation capacity of an internet player. 

We do this in three steps: 
1. We have rebuilt the mobile core network the "internet way"
2. We make our software work consistently across radio networks enabling a "build once for everyone" modality
3. We are opening up the core network functionality for developers to build products not previously possible or practical

Our success is measured by users that find their mobile subscription that much more useful. 

# The technical view

In more technical terms we have built a full stack MVNO core network. This includes the functionality of the HLR/HSS, the MSC, the SMSC and MMSC and the PGW. This means we control the user database, the signalling and media stream related to voice, messaging and internet connectivity. This enables us to build value enhancing products together with the eco-system on top of this basic functionality. 

The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the cloud. We put the packet gateway locally. 

We work together with our customers to integrate into the host mobile network and partners for interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other necessary pieces. For the sake of clarity, we only deliver the mobile core network as-a-service, and partner for the rest. 

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements. We are a neutral platform for an eco-system of partners and developers.
