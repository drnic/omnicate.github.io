Working Group Two gives mobile operators the innovation capacity of Internet players.
By delivering the mobile core gateway nodes as-a-service and leveraging the benefits of being cloud native,
we radically enhance the innovation capacity of operators, and in parallel dramatically reduce cost and complexity.

{% include left-right-image.html img="cloud-native.svg" title="A platform for innovation" text="
    Inspired by smartphone app stores, we are building an ecosystem of innovation on top of the mobile core network.
    We expose network capabilities through APIs, so end-users, third parties and
    operators themselves can build products on the platform.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="app-ecosystem.svg" title="As-a-service" text="
    By offering our platform as-a-service we ensure that all operators benefit from the aggregated benefits
    of the improvements made on the platform. We constantly deploy new features,
    integrate new products, improve security and redundancy and develop the next ''G'' for you.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="cloud-native.svg" title="Cloud native" text="
    Our platform is built to leverage cloud infrastructure. We currently operate out of
    public clouds, but can move to private cloud environments as well.
    By leveraging the best of cloud infrastructure we can be agile,
    cost effective and focus on what creates value for operators and end-users.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="app-ecosystem.svg" title="Operator friendly" text="
    When partnering with us, operators get access to unique functionality they can use to grow their user base.
    Our business model is primarily based on a per-user fee, so we really want our operators to succeed.
    Benchmarks have shown we can cut costs up to 50% on a TCO basis.
"%}

We focus on making a difference for both operators and end-users.
When we succeed in our mission, operators on our platform have more satisfied 
customers that use their mobile connectivity in new and meaningful ways.
