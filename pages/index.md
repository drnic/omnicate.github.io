# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This reach has a price. Standardization, local implementations and decades of legacy have effectively stifled product innovation, leaving new products to come from internet players.

We are about combining the reach of mobile operators with the innovation capacity of an internet player. 

We do this in four steps: 
1. We rebuild telco the "internet way"
2. We make our software work across radio networks
3. We open up network functionality previously hidden from view 
4. We create the basis for an product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work for multiple operators in multiple geographies.

Our success is measured by that end-users find their mobile subscription much more useful. 

# The technical view

In more technical terms we have built a full stack MVNO core network. This includes the functionality of the HLR/HSS, the MSC, the SMSC and MMSC and the PGW. This means we control the user database, the signalling and media streams related to voice, messaging and internet connectivity. Among other innovations we have webRTC compatability in-built into the platform. With control of these media and control planes we are inviting developers to help build services for end-users that are more useful and interesting. 

The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the cloud. We will usually deploy the packet gateway locally. 

We work together with our customers to integrate into the host mobile network and partners for interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other necessary pieces. For the sake of clarity, we only deliver the mobile core network as-a-service, and partner for the rest. 

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements. We are a neutral platform for an eco-system of operators, partners and developers.
