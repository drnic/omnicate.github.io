# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This reach has a price. Standardization, local implementations and decades of legacy have effectively stifled product innovation, leaving new products to come from internet players.

We are about combining the reach of mobile operators with the innovation capacity of an internet player. 

We do this in four steps: 
1. We rebuild telco the "internet way"
2. We make our software work across radio networks
3. We open up network functionality previously hidden from view 
4. We create the basis for an product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work for multiple operators in multiple geographies.

Our success is measured by that end-users find their mobile subscription much more useful.
