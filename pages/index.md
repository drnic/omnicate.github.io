# What are we about?

We work to bridge the mobile telecom and Internet worlds. We want to give mobile operators the innovation capacity of Internet players. We work to solve the following problems for mobile operators
1. Getting mobile core networks to work across radio networks and geographies
2. Making the mobile core network open, accessible and programmable for developers
3. Getting the benefits of all operators on the platform

We get there by making the mobile core network accessible and programmable through 
1. Rebuilding mobile telco the "Internet way" 
2. Building cloud-native infrastructure, and leveraging cloud providers
3. Opening up previously unexposed network capabilities
4. Building the foundation for a product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work across operators.

We focus on making a difference for the end-user. When we succeed in our mission, operators on our platform have more satisfied customers that use their mobile connectivity in new and meaningful ways.
