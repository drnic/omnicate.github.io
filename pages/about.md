# About Working Group Two

In the mid-80s a small band of Norwegian scientists challenged European tech giants in defining the modulation, coding and access systems for what would later be known as the GSM standard. The standards body deciding on the future standard wanted to accelerate progress and chose to arrange a competition. Whoever had the best solution when testing the solution in Paris would win. Against all odds, the small band of engineers came out as the winners. The scope of their efforts were defined under Working Group Two.

We find inspiration in their story, and believe that with bright people, commitment and a willingness to invest for the long-term you can achieve great things.

We started our work in Telenor, a global communications company, but we are now a separate and independent legal entity. 

WorkingGroupTwo is owned approximately 5% by the board and employees, with the remaining stakes held in equal proportion by Telenor and Digital Alpha LLP. 

Cisco is partner to the company and contributes with technology, products and customer discussions.

The company has offices in Oslo and Stockholm, with a hub in Trondheim. The team consists mainly of software engineers, some telco engineers and a few other people to herd the flock.
