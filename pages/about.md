# About Working Group Two

In the mid-80s a small band of Norwegian scientists challenged European tech giants in defining the modulation, coding and access systems for what would later be known as the GSM standard. The standards body deciding on the future standard wanted to accelerate progress and chose to arrange a competition. Whoever had the best solution when testing the solution in Paris would win. Against all odds, the small band of engineers from Norway came out as the winners. The scope of their efforts were defined under the mandate to WorkingGroupTwo.

We find inspiration in their story, and believe that with bright people, commitment and a willingness to invest for the long-term you can achieve great things.

We started our work in Telenor, a global communications company, but we are now a separate and independent legal entity. WorkingGroupTwo is owned about 5% by the board and employees, with the remaining stake held in equal proportion by Telenor and Digital Alpha. Cisco is partner to the company and contributes with technology, products and customer discussions.
