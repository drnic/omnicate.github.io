Working Group Two (also known as “Working Group 2”, “wgtwo” and “wg2”) is working to make the mobile
subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today. We are giving mobile operators the
ability to work the “Internet way”. This includes promoting a platform logic, taking control of
the technology, enabling rapid iterations and focusing on the end-user experience.

Our strategy is to make the mobile core network programmable and accessible for third parties.
At the heart of our effort is building a mobile core network, delivered as-a-service.
We then enable this network to run across different radio networks. Finally, we expose core
network functionality through APIs to third parties. The logic is not unlike that of operating
systems in the smartphone world: A homogeneous software layer on top of heterogeneous hardware
to enable a platform of innovative products and services.

We have offices in Oslo, Stockholm and Trondheim.

Working Group Two was spun off from the Telenor Group in October 2017.
