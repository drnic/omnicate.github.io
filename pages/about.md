Working Group Two wants to change the telecom industry.
Our ambition is to make your mobile subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today.

Our strategy is to make the mobile core network flexible, programmable, and accessible for third parties.
At the heart of our effort is building a cloud-based mobile core network, delivered as-a-service.
We then enable this network to run across different radio networks.
Finally, we expose core network functionality through APIs.
Think of it as an operating systems in the smartphone world:
A software layer on top of different hardware to enable a
platform of innovative products and services.

We have offices in Stockholm and Oslo, and a hub in Trondheim.
We offer competitive compensation packages, and the opportunity to take part in the upside of the company.
We are a mix between a start-up and a traditional company.
We sometimes refer to it as a “start-up for grown-ups”,
a naming that hints to how seriously we take our responsibilities.
Our end-users rely on our services to manage their every-day lives.

We have come together to change one of the world's largest industries.
It will require massive effort, inspired choices and taking calculated risk.
We find inspiration in our differences. We believe that bright people,
strong commitment and long-term perspective can achieve great things.

## Our history
In the mid-80s a small band of Norwegian scientists challenged European tech giants in defining the modulation,
coding and access systems for what would later be known as the GSM standard.

The standards body wanted to accelerate progress and chose to arrange a competition to force a decision.
During test drives in Paris, whoever had the best solution would win become the standard.
It was a daunting task. In Europe the big technology companies were effectively national champions,
and invested vast resources. The few engineers in Norway had few of these resources,
but they understood the technology challenge at hand, were willing to think out of the box and had operational closeness.

The scope of their efforts were defined under **Working Group Two**.

We find inspiration in their story, and believe that with bright people,
a willingness to bet on new technologies, commitment and a willingness to
invest for the long-term you can achieve great things.

We started our project inside an operator, but we are now a separate and independent legal entity.
