## Integrating with us

We work with our customers to select and integrate with the host mobile network,
as well as interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other partners.
We deliver the mobile core network as-a-service,
and integrate with partners for the remaining services.
The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the public cloud.
We will usually deploy the packet gateway locally.

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements.
