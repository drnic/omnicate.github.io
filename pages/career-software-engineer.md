# Software Engineer

Working Group Two is here to change the telco industry, and to do so we need more great people. We are on a mission to make mobile subscriptions much more useful and relevant by providing programmable mobile networks for everyone. The way we do this is to change the way traditional telco work and deliver mobile core network services from the cloud. This includes making mobile operators work on a platform, controlling our own technology, enabling rapid iterations and focus on the end-user experience. 

## Software Engineer

We are now looking to welcome an experienced software engineer to join our office in Stockholm, and continue to develop our platform with new key features.
Most of our components are in-house developed in Java/Kotlin, Go, or Erlang, and are deployed on our self-managed Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. We are however language agnostic and believe in using the right tool for the job. 
We are firmly rooted in having people own their own work. This means that you are allowed a lot of freedom when it comes to planning and which features to build. However, our engineers who develop the code are also responsible for operating the code once in production. We adhere to principles that include the use of continuous integration, continuous delivery, microservices and infrastructure as code. 

## We believe you have experience with: 

* Writing distributed, well designed services in a JVM language such as Kotlin or Java, and at least one other programming language, such as Go, C#, C++, Erlang, Python, Rust or Javascript.
* Building large scalable solutions. 
* Caring about and shipping quality code.
* Scalable cloud services (AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers). 
* It is an added bonus if you have knowledge of the telco industry, telco protocols, VoIP systems or know networking by heart, but it is not required.

## Our culture 
We are challenging a well-established multi-billion dollar industry, and this is not a trivial task.  In order to do so, we need to continue delivering high-quality solutions on par with the existing standards, while embedding innovation in the way we operate and create value for the end-users. This is why we believe our people and culture is our key differentiator. 

Joining us, you will get a lot of freedom and responsibility to create a big impact in the telco industry and you will be surrounded by friendly colleagues with high expertise. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a “start-up for grown-ups”. We know where we are going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we co-create the path to get there. 

You will be part of a distributed team with main offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm as well as some remote colleagues in other locations. We believe in doing things together and that is why we frequently host company wide activities like tech talks, demos, and Failure Fridays. We also make sure everyone can get together at an offsite three times a year to have fun, discuss important topics and hack on crazy projects.
