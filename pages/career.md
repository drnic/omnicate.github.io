# Join us

Our ambition is to make your mobile subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today. For that we need to change the way traditional telecom works. We need to make telecom work the "internet way", including making platform, controlling our own technology, rapid iterations and focus on the end-user experience.

We are rapidly expanding our team. We have offices in Stockholm and Oslo. We offer competitive base compensation packages, and the opportunity to take part in the upside of the company. We are a mix between a start-up and a traditional company, we sometimes call it "start-up for grown-ups".

**We are hiring** in the following areas:

*   **Ops and infrastruture** specialists to help us build a secure, flexible and scalable telco grade infrastructure the Internet way (experience with AWS and Docker is helpful)
*   **Mobile** core experts that can help us bring the telco world into the Internet world
*   **Developers and product managers** with experience of building **APIs/SDKs** as products for developers
*   **Backend and front-end developers** with experience and passion for real time communication services, security, and scalable services
*   **Product managers** with a strong passion for communication related services
*   A very special **sales talent with strong technical insight**, an industry network and the ability to generate a new industry through helping us build our next generation of partners on the platform

Most of our team are software engineers with limited experience in the telecom domain. However, we also needs translators and integrators that deeply understand the telecom world.
