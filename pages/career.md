# Join us at our "startup for grown-ups"

Working Group Two is here to change the telecom industry, and to do so we need more great people. Our ambition is to make your mobile subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today. We need to make mobile operators work the “Internet way”. This includes promoting a platform logic, taking control of the technology, enabling rapid iterations and focusing on the end-user experience.

Our strategy is to make the mobile core network programmable and accessible for third parties. At the heart of our effort is building a mobile core network, delivered as-a-service. We then enable this network to run across different radio networks. Finally, we expose core network functionality through APIs to third parties. The logic is not unlike that of operating systems in the smartphone world, a homogeneous software layer on top of heterogeneous hardware to create a platform for innovation. 

We have offices in Stockholm and Oslo, with a hub in Trondheim. We offer competitive compensation packages, and the opportunity to take part in the upside of the company. We are a mix between a start-up and a traditional company. We sometimes refer to it as a “start-up for grown-ups”, a naming that hints to how seriously we take our responsiblities. Our end-users rely on our services to manage their every-day lives. 

We have come together to change one of the world's largest industries. It will require massive effort, inspired choices and taking calculated risk. We find inspiration in our differences. We believe that bright people, strong commitment and long-term perspective can achieve great things.

**We are hiring** in the following areas:

*   **Ops and infrastructure** specialists to help us build a secure, flexible and scalable telecom grade infrastructure the Internet way (experience with AWS and Docker is helpful)
*   **Mobile core network** experts that can help us bring the telecom world into the Internet world
*   **Developers and product managers** with experience of building **APIs/SDKs** as products for developers
*   **Back-end and front-end developers** with experience and passion for real time communication services, security, and scalable services

Having telecom domain knowledge is not a requirement.

**If you are interested in any of these positions, or if you think you are a good fit for another role, let us get to know you. Please send us a short description about yourself to <career@wgtwo.com>.**
