We aim to make a huge impact in our industry and foster strong personal growth while doing it.

We believe in transparency, so we've created a page outlining our [interview process](/our-interview-process).
If you would like to join us, please write a bit about yourself and email us at <career@wgtwo.com>.
We take your privacy seriously, so we have created a [privacy page](/privacy) to explain how we treat your data.

## Working at Working Group Two
We're a distributed team, but invest in people getting to know each other across locations.
Every quarter the entire company meets up for two/three days to have fun and to get to know each other better.
Here we find time for events like sledding, skiing, cross-fit, karaoke, you name it!
