# Software / Infrastructure Engineer

Working Group Two is here to change the telco industry, and to do so we need more great people. We are on a mission to make mobile subscriptions much more useful and relevant by providing programmable mobile networks for everyone. The way we do this is to change the way traditional telco work and deliver mobile core network services from the cloud. This includes making mobile operators work on a platform, controlling our own technology, enabling rapid iterations and focus on the end-user experience. 

We are now looking for an experienced infrastructure engineer or software engineer with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us in Stockholm and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure. Spanning many disciplines, we work to make the business work; creating the frameworks, capabilities, and tools needed to welcome a million users. The infrastructure team is responsible for the setup and management of our AWS accounts and Kubernetes clusters, running internal services, and building internal tools when we can't find something to meet our needs. The goal is to be able to run our core network in any cloud environment (or internal data center)! We follow the tenets of modern cloud infrastructure -- we build and deploy our production systems in an immutable manner, from code. We believe in thorough metrics, monitoring, and alerting. We feel that our teams should own their services, but we in the infrastructure team should provide powerful tools to enable this.

We believe you have experience with at least some of the following:

* Writing distributed, well-designed services and you know what it means to ship high-quality code.
* Building infrastructure to scale up.
* Managing container-based workloads, using K8s or other orchestration software.
* AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers.

## Our culture 
We are challenging a well-established multi-billion dollar industry, and this is not a trivial task. In order to do so, we need to continue delivering high-quality solutions on par with the existing standards, while embedding innovation in the way we operate and create value for the end-users. This is why we believe our people and culture is our key differentiator. 

Joining us, you will get a lot of freedom and responsibility to create a big impact in the telco industry and you will be surrounded by friendly colleagues with high expertise. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a “start-up for grown-ups”. We know where we are going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we co-create the path to get there. 

You will be part of a distributed team with offices in Oslo, Trondheim, and Stockholm. We believe in doing things together and that is why we frequently host company-wide activities like tech talks, demos, and Failure Fridays. We also make sure everyone can get together at an offsite three times a year to have fun, discuss important topics and hack on crazy projects.
